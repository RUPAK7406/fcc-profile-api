        "_desc": "* Welcome to Free Code Camp. We're an open source community that helps you learn to code, then practice by building projects for nonprofits.\n* Learning to code is hard. To succeed, you'll need lots of practice and support. That's why we've created a rigorous curriculum and supportive community.\n* Free Code Camp is a proven path to your first software developer job. Companies have hired thousands of people like you who have learned to code through Free Code Camp.\n* There are thousands of software developer jobs currently going unfilled, and the demand for coders grows every year.\n* We have hundreds of optional coding challenges that will teach you fundamental web development technologies like HTML5, Node.js and databases.\n* We believe humans learn best by doing. So you'll spend most of your time actually building projects. We'll give you a list of specifications (agile user stories), and you'll figure out how to build apps that fulfill those specifications.\n* Our curriculum is divided into 4 certifications. These certifications are standardized, and instantly verifiable by your freelance clients and future employers. Like everything else at Free Code Camp, these certifications are free. We recommend doing them in order, but you are free to jump around. The first three certifications take 400 hours each, and the final certification takes 800 hours, and involves building real-life projects for nonprofits.\n* To earn our verified Front End Development Certification, you'll build 10 projects using HTML, CSS, jQuery, and JavaScript.\n* To earn our Data Visualization Certification, you'll build 10 projects using React, Sass and D3.js.\n* To earn our Back End Development Certification, you'll build 10 projects using Node.js, Express, and MongoDB. You'll use Git and Heroku to deploy them to the cloud.\n* After you complete all three of these certificates, you'll team up with another camper and use agile software development methodologies to build two real-life projects for nonprofits. You'll also add functionality to two legacy code nonprofit projects. By the time you finish, you'll have a portfolio of real apps that people use every day.\n* If you complete all 2,080 hours worth of challenges and projects, you'll earn our Full Stack Development Certification. We'll offer you free coding interview practice. We even offer a job board where employers specifically hire campers who've earned Free Code Camp certifications.\n",

First you'll need a GitHub account.\n* Click the \"Open link in new tab\" button below to open up GitHub. Create a GitHub account by filling in the form. Be sure to use your real email address - GitHub will keep this private. Then check your email inbox for an email from GitHub. Open it and click the \"verify email address\" button inside it. Note: If you already have a GitHub account, you can skip this step by clicking \"Open link in new tab\", closing the new tab that opens, then clicking \"go to my next step\". We removed our \"skip step\" button because many people would just click it repeatedly without doing these important steps.\n* Click the pixel art in the upper right hand corner of GitHub, then choose settings. Upload a picture of yourself. A picture of your face works best. This is how your fellow campers will see you in our chat rooms, so look your best. You can add your city and your name if you want.\n* Open Free Code Camp's open-source repository. This is where our volunteer team collaborates on building Free Code Camp.\n* Now that you have a GitHub account, you can join our main chat room by logging in with GitHub. Introduce yourself by saying \"Hello world!\" Tell your fellow campers how you found Free Code Camp. Also tell us why you want to learn to code.\n* Our chat rooms are extremely active. You should change your settings so you're only notified if someone mentions you.\n* Please note that all of our chat rooms are visible to the public. If you need to share sensitive information, such as an email address or phone number, do it in a private message.\n* Keep our chat room open while you work through our challenges. That way, you can ask for help if you get stuck. You can also socialize with other campers when you feel like taking a break.\n* You can also download the chat room app to your computer or phone.\n",

You wouldn't expect to beat a chess master after playing for 3 months. Don't expect to build the next Facebook after coding for 3 months.\n* Keep practicing coding every day and hanging out with other people who code, and you will become a job-ready coder.\n* Any time you get stuck or don't know what to do next: Read-Search-Ask.\n* First, read the documentation or error message. A key skill that good coders have is the ability to interpret and then follow instructions.\n* If that didn't help, search Google. Good Google queries take a lot of practice. When you search Google, you usually want to include the language or framework you're using. You also want to limit the results to a recent period.\n* If that didn't help, ask your friends. If you have trouble, you can ask your fellow campers in our help chat room.\n* Now you're ready to start coding. The \"Map\" button in your upper right hand corner will show you our challenge map. We recommend that you complete these from top to bottom, at a sustainable pace. Our open source community is constantly improving our challenges, so don't be surprised if they change or move around.

This is the most powerful method of all. But before we do it, let's talk about why you would ever want to override CSS.\n* In many situations, you will use CSS libraries. These may accidentally override your own CSS. So when you absolutely need to be sure that an element has specific CSS, you can use !important\n* Let's go all the way back to our pink-text class declaration. Remember that our pink-text class was overridden by subsequent class declarations, id declarations, and in-line styles.\n* Let's add the keyword !important to your pink-text element's color declaration to make 100% sure that your h1 element will be pink.\n* An example of how to do this is:\n* color: red !important;\n",

One of these ways is called hexadecimal code, or hex code for short.\n* We usually use decimals, or base 10 numbers, which use the symbols 0 to 9 for each digit. Hexadecimals (or hex) are base 16 numbers. This means it uses sixteen distinct symbols. Like decimals, the symbols 0-9 represents values zero to nine. Then A,B,C,D,E,F represent values ten to fifteen. Altogether, 0 to F can represent a digit in hexadecimal, giving us 16 total possible values. You can find more information about hexadecimal numbers here.\n* In CSS, we can use 6 hexadecimal digits to represent colors, two each for the red (R), green (G), and blue (B) components. For example, #000000 is black and is also the lowest possible value. You can find more information about the RGB color system here.\n* Replace the word black in our body element's background-color with its hex code representation, #000000.\n",

Most of Bootstrap's classes can be applied to a div element.\n* Here's a diagram of how Bootstrap's 12-column grid layout works:\n* \n* Note that in this illustration, the col-md-* class is being used. Here, md means medium, and * is a number specifying how many columns wide the element should be. In this case, the column width of an element on a medium-sized screen, such as a laptop, is being specified.\n* In the Cat Photo App that we're building, we'll use col-xs-*, where xs means extra small (like an extra-small mobile phone screen), and * is the number of columns specifying how many columns wide the element should be.\n* Nest your first image and your h2 element within a single <div class=\"row\"> element. Nest your h2 element within a <div class=\"col-xs-8\"> and your image in a <div class=\"col-xs-4\"> so that they are on the same line.\n* Notice how the image is now just the right size to fit along the text?\n",

Then close it on the following line (still inside your script element) with: });\n* We'll learn more about functions later.

We'll use a popular browser-based code editor called CodePen.\n* These projects are hard. It takes most campers several days to build each project. You will get frustrated. But don't quit. This gets easier with practice.\n* When you get stuck, just use the Read-Search-Ask methodology. Don't worry - you've got this.\n* For our front end project challenges, we'll use a popular browser-based code editor called CodePen. Click the \"Open link in new tab\" button below to open CodePen's signup page. Fill out the form and click \"Sign up\". Note: If you already have a CodePen account, you can skip this step by clicking \"Open link in new tab\", closing the new tab that opens, then clicking \"go to my next step\". We removed our \"skip step\" button because many people would just click it repeatedly without doing these important steps.\n* In the HTML box, create an h1 element with the text \"Hello World\". You can drag the frames around to resize them. You can also click the \"Change View\" button and change the orientation of the frames.\n* Click the gear in the upper left hand corner of the CSS box, then scroll down to \"Quick add\" and choose Bootstrap. Now give your h1 element the class of text-primary to change its color and prove that Bootstrap is now available.\n* When using CodePen and Ajax, it is a good idea to turn off automatic preview updating so API calls are not made too often. Too many API calls can sometimes lead to temporary blockages, and may require waiting periods before they can be used again.   To disable automatic preview updating click the \"Settings\" button at the top of the page, then click the \"Behavior\" tab. At the bottom of the page, un-check \"AUTO UPDATE PREVIEW\". Now press \"Run\" at the top of the page to update the preview, and click \"Save\".\n",

Computers can perform mathematical operations on a number, but not on a string.\n* Variables allow computers to store and manipulate data in a dynamic fashion. They do this by using a \"label\" to point to the data rather than using the data itself. Any of the seven data types may be stored in a variable.\n* Variables are similar to the x and y variables you use in mathematics, which means they're a simple name to represent the data we want to refer to. Computer variables differ from mathematical variables in that they can store different values at different times.\n* We tell JavaScript to create or declare a variable by putting the keyword var in front of it, like so:\n* creates a variable called ourName. In JavaScript we end statements with semicolons.\n* Variable names can be made up of numbers, letters, and $ or _, but may not contain spaces or start with a number.\n* Use the var keyword to create a variable called myName.\n* HintLook at the ourName example if you get stuck.\n",

Then copy its .git URL.Return to c9.io's terminal and set your GitHub remote URL: git remote add origin followed by the URL you copied from GitHub.Run git push origin master.Now tab back to GitHub and refresh, and you'll see that your code is now on GitHub.You can now delete the hello world example code and begin your API project!\n* We will soon add instructions for getting your API projects deployed to Heroku. For now, develop your projects right on c9.io.\n",

Click the big plus symbol to create a new workspace. Enter your email address when prompted.\n* Instead of starting from scratch, we recommend using Clementine.js, a full stack JavaScript \"boilerplate\" that already has some basic code written for you. Clementine.js has a detailed tutorial you can go through to build it yourself, but for now let's just clone its code.On c9.io, give your workspace a name, then leave \"Template\" as custom and create your workspace from this GitHub url: https://github.com/johnstonbl01/clementinejs-fcc.git\n* Click the gear in the upper right corner of c9.io's file structure.

For the homepage URL, paste the URL from your preview tab. You'll also paste the URL from your preview tab into \"Authorization callback URL\", then add to it: auth/github/callback\n* GitHub will create an app and present you with a Client ID and a Client Secret. Set your .env file's GITHUB_KEY equal to the Client ID, and set your .env file's GITHUB_SECRET equal to the Client Secret. Copy the URL from your preview tab and paste it into your .env file as your APP_URL.\n* In your terminal, install MongoDB by entering: sudo apt-get install mongodb-org then start MongoDB by entering:mongod --smallfiles\n* Open a new terminal tab with the + button above your terminal, then run npm install\n* Run node server.js to start the server. Refresh your preview tab. You should see the Clementine.js logo. Click \"sign in\" and accept GitHub's prompt to authorize the application.\n* Click the \"Click Me\" button and you'll see that it increments the number clicks.

There's an event called 'DOMContentLoaded', and once that event happens, whatever is loaded will be displayed.\n* The DOM will tell the browser it's ready once the HTML is loaded, and sometimes the CSS and JS hasn't caught up. However, if you place the CSS in the header and the JS in the footer, you can ensure that all content will be loaded before the DOM triggers the 'DOMContentLoaded' event, the event that shows the user your content.\n* This is a simple explanation, as most of these videos are.

Methods are powerful - many times when you want your script to do something, there's a method for that.\n* Functions, like variables, are something you define and create.\n* During your algorithm practice at Free Code Camp, you will create functions that take a certain piece of information and manipulate it in whatever way you choose.\n* You'll become more familiar with syntax there, but for now, just remember that with methods and functions you can do almost anything with your code.\n",

O represents the function, and (n) represents the number of elements to be acted on.\n* Worst-case time complexity, the longest it could possibly take with any valid input, is the most common way to express time complexity.\n* When you discuss Big-O notation, that is generally referring to the worst case scenario.\n* For example, if we have to search two lists for common entries, we will calculate as if both entries would be at the very end of each list, just to be safe that we don't underestimate how long it could take.\n* O(1) - determining if a number is odd or even. O(1) is a static amount of time, the same no matter how much information is there or how many users there are.\n* O(log N) - finding a word in the dictionary (using binary search). Binary search is an example of a type of 'divide and conquer' algorithm.\n* O(N) - reading a book\n* O(N log N) - sorting a deck of playing cards (using merge sort)\n* O(N^2) - checking if you have everything on your shopping list in your cart\n* O(infinity) - tossing a coin until it lands on heads\n* As a rule of thumb, anything with N^2 or any other exponent is NOT a good algorithm for a site with multiple users.\n* If your algorithm slows down exponentially with the input, you're going to want to look for a more efficient way to solve that problem.\n* Whenever you’re coding loops within loops, you want to be especially mindful of time complexity.\n* Big O Cheat Sheet is the place to look once you can classify your algorithm, like as a 'merge-sort' or a 'quick-sort'.\n* bigocheatsheet.com/\n* Princeton Coursera course is NOT for the faint of heart.
